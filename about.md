Unorthodox Artspace is a DIY art space and music venue located right by Dolores Park, a famous gathering & green space in SF’s Mission District.  The building was originally an orthodox synagogue founded in 1908, two years after the major earthquake destroyed most of San Francisco. The congregation closed in the 1970s due to dwindling membership, then a few artists purchased the building and turned it into their living spaces, studios, and gallery space. Now we are returning it to the community as a community art space! We named the space Unorthodox to respect the origins of the building, while also emphasizing this is no longer a religious space. We aim to create a safer, inclusive, lqbtq+ friendly,  anti-racist environment. 

Our hope is to create a community art space with a good amount of underground music, performance & installation art, poetry readings, workshops, visual art shows, screenings, dance and maybe even bodywork. We occupy one quarter of the original sanctuary space, and the main performance area is essentially a white box theater with a balcony and a huge skylight. The room measures 30’x30’x30’. 

We are now booking this Summer through next Fall and beyond. Please DM us on Instagram for the chance to play in this unique venue! The space is also available to rent for events, DM us to learn more.
